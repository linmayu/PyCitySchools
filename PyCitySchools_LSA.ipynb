    "Higher budgets appear to be inversely correlated with better student outcomes - schools with budgets under $615 per student are outperforming schools with budgets over $615 per student.  Charter schools also have lower budgets than district schools and better student outcomes, which might explain this difference.  It would be useful to study the differences between charter and district schools in greater detail than is captured in this dataset."
