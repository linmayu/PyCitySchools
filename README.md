Analysis of student outcomes in PyCity School District

# PyCitySchools Analysis

Overall, math and reading scores at each school are consistent across grade levels.
Higher budgets appear to be inversely correlated with better student outcomes - schools with budgets under $615 per student are 
outperforming schools with budgets over $615 per student.  Charter schools also have lower budgets than district schools and better 
student outcomes, which might explain this difference.  It would be useful to study the differences between charter and district schools 
in greater detail than is captured in this dataset.
